Article: “Is High Quality Software Worth the Cost?”

An article by Martin Fowler on the idea that "quality" is abstract and goal focused, he puts it as a practical economic decision. He further explains how things like tests and refactoring are not just luxuries but means to reduce cost and risk. I like his argument because it is convincing as it connects technical debt directly to business outcomes and not just developer happiness

It relates with working on projects that start fast and scrappy then slowly become painful to change. This article kinda explains why some teams move faster while others grind to a halt. I like how it is deep and makes me think about making a software just to get it to work.
